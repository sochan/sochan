title: Non-stop energy
description: Super, we can get solar, wind turbine, it seems we should get it from all movements, is it we waste our energy, the movement-->power, so is it possible to recharge the power while the car is moving?

A car is consumming a battery power to make it move, why during its movements cannot it recharge the power to the container. For example, it should be 2 battery A and B for a car, A and B are charging from solar if it is available and while the engine start it should be switch to one of the atteries to serve the mecanics and the car move. For example, car is using battery A to move for 100Km, during the movement and using A, shoul it charge to battery B from the car movement and it will switch the battery while it detect A is weak, can it create a non stop power. It is just my dream.
