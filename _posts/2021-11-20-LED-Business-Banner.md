Waitting the barber this morning for half and one hour, one idea blowing me up. Is it better to replace the static LED in front of the shop to show a useful message or words of the day for the shop owner??? Genience!!!!

Is it better to replace the static LED in front of the shop to show a useful message or words of the day for the shop owner??? Genience!!!!

The barber, his shop actually opens at 9am on Saturday, he told once he should be opening at 8.30am. I came very early this morning, hoping to get my hair-cut first and leaving my three kids at home, it would be pretty much enough time until they would wake up. It was shiny at the beginning, the temperature was quite good for me standing in front of the shop seeing the train, cars, people nearby the place but it was very cold after standing for 15 minutes. Unfortunately, for more than one hour, the barber was still not showing up, I had tried several calls. I got his phone from Google listing his shop’s name but still could not reach him. He may be in any urgent situation or very busy to answer, I did not know. 

Looking at his blue LED light showing his shop’s name, I realized one thing, he should tell me in his LED that “Hi my Dear friends, I have contacted COVID19 now, please come back in a few days!!” Just kidding, I don't wish him this bad luck, I hate COVID19, so some of my examples may be related to COVID19, wishing him good luck, hopefully nothing happening to him. See that technology???? he should update the message to the LED banner remotely, from his smart phone or any handheld devices.

Hope to deliver this one day. It is also a good idea to do dynamic banners for advertisements, welcome messages to VIPs or surprising messages to beloved people, …etc.

Thank YOU!!!!
