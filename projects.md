					<h3>CSIRO - Annotating Text, 2019</h3>
				</header>
				<p> The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (<a href='https://www.csiro.au' target='_blank'>CSIRO</a>), it was amazing for this opportunity to work for the well-known research organization in Australia. The aim of this project is to create a RESTful API that can be used to annotate a text with definitions, taken from controlled vocabulary services. Technical documents use terminology with the intention of specific words and phrases which denote more or less precise definitions of some concept. However, in many cases a term has more than one definition in different vocabularies, which can differ either a little or a lot. Accurate understanding of a text can be enabled by hyperlinking all technical terms to the intended definitions. This project will develop a tool and web micro-service to enable semi-automated annotation of a text with hyperlinks to the definitions of terminology used. The definitions should in turn be sourced from a range of vocabularies (i.e. sources of terms), accessed through ‘standard’ APIs. Technologies: NodeJS, IBM Cloud, CloudantDB, IBM Natural Language Processing, BootStrap. <a href="https://github.com/sochan/CSIROAnnotatingText" class="icon fa-github" target="_blank"><span class="label">Github</span></a></p>

					<p>The project of recipes application aims to guide users to cook their favourite food through the recipes recommendation application. The end user only need to input the key word of ingredients and the application will give them instant results about the relevant recipes and all the detailed steps of cooking, which help users to develop their cooking skills. Initially, this application will require users categorise their favourite types of food, like Chinese food, Vietnamese food, Malaysia food and so on.

For example, some people prefer to cook healthy food, so the recommended recipes will be with light oil and included some high protein food recommendation. Also, the user can save these recipes by login our application as a member. Our system will be designed to process the considerable amount of data from mobile application, which involved in relational database to boost the recommendation of recipes effectiveness.
